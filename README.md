How It Works

User clicks the Kanye button
App sends a GET request to the API
JSON response is parsed
Quote text is updated on the canvas

What I Learned

API integration in Python
GUI design using Tkinter Canvas
Handling JSON responses
Event handling with buttons

Future Improvements

Add loading animation
I prove UI responsiveness
Add quote history feature
